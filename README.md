# Postal Address Databases Matching
In France, as in numerous other countries, postal addresses are gathered across various systems managed by multiple organizations. Prominent among these are La Poste, along with entities such as IGN, DGFIP, municipalities, telephone, internet, electricity, gas, or water operators. Additionally, the State has recently introduced the National Address Base (BAN) to establish an authoritative and comprehensive address repository.
These addresses originate from diverse origins, including land surveys, postal envelope scans, or declarations from property owners. Despite standardized address formats in France, there exist multiple representations for the same address in certain cases.
The objective of this research project is to devise an effective Machine Learning-based approach for comparing and matching addresses efficiently.
